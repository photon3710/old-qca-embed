class Solution:
    '''A Solution object is constructed from the results of running a solver on
    a QCA circuit. It is assumed that the solver approach is to find the
    spectra of each clock zone for all possible inputs. The Solution object
    contains methods to analyse these results in order to determine propoerties
    of the whole circuit.'''
