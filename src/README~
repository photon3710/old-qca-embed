This directory contains the python source code for running and testing the two
embedding algorithms.

Code is written for Python 2.7 but most should work for 2.6 or 3.*

See scripts in the examples folder for samples of how to call the various scripts
and the correct call order.


Prerequisites:
	Certain components of the code require different libraries to be installed.
	To be safe, most scripts require both numpy and scipy to be installed for
	mathematical operations. Any plotting will be done through matplotlib via
	pylab. Other modules for basic operation should be included with your 
	native build of Python 2.7.
	
	The scipt convert.py in dense-placement makes use of the PuLP module for 
	linear programming with GLPK as the integer programming optimization solver.
	Linux users should install glpk (python-glpk and glpk-utils) if not included
	already in their distribution. Alternatively, users can alter convert.py to 
	use the default solver by changing the USE_DEFAULT flag in convert.py.
	
	Installation of missing modules should be done through pip or equivalent
	for consistency.
	
	Summary: 	numpy
				scipy ( >= 0.14.0)
				matplotlib
				PuLP (+ glpk)
